## Burning questions:

> **Can Blocksi spy on me through the webcam?**
> 
> Answer: Yes. According to the Blocksi FAQ (Question 13) "the camera can be used for audio-video conferencing." What does this mean? We're not exactly sure. Does my school have the ability to spy on us at home through our webcams? It would seem so. Has ours ever done this? Not to our knowledge. It seems unlikely that this technology would be used.
> 
> Do take comfort however in the fact that their website seems to suggest that teachers can only spy on students during their class time.

> **What exactly can Blocksi do?**
> 
> Blocksi does a lot of things. Anything that can be detected from your Chromebook, it would appear that they track it.
> 
> For example (and not limited to):
> 
> - Viewing every tab you have open
> - Viewing your entire screen
> - Assessing the appropriateness of a website and notifying school authorities (API documentation for this coming soon)
> - Parent dashboard
> - Website blocking
> - Teacher-student messaging
> - Student analytics
> - Track your location
> - Lock Chromebook to specific website
> - and more

> **How thorough is Blocksi?**
> 
> As I mentioned previously, Blocksi tracks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything.</span> However, this is more thorough than you would think. Here's a screenshot from their website to give you an idea:

> **What can I do?**
> 
> Check out the [Workarounds](https://pen.jvadair.com/books/blocksi/chapter/workarounds "Workarounds") section for more information.
> 
> As a general rule of thumb, behave when on your Chromebook. You should also avoid using using your Chromebook and school google account (including Drive, Hangouts, etc.) for non-school purposes.

> **Isn't this illegal?!**
> 
> Sadly, no. It complies with the CIPA act (read their FAQ)
